# VAPT Summary Report: Preparedness, Safety & Continuity Portal: Workforce Locator

## 1. Executive Summary
This report summarizes the security posture of the **Preparedness, Safety & Continuity Portal: Workforce Locator**. The platform is designed with security-first principles, focusing on personnel data privacy, RBAC integrity, and API stability.

## 2. Security Assessment Scope
- **Infrastructure**: Containerized Docker (Sail/Dockerfile) environment.
- **Application Logic**: Laravel 12 framework core.
- **API Endpoints**: `/api/location` (Telemetry submission) and administrative controllers.
- **Database**: Persistence layer integrity and access control.

## 3. Implemented Security Controls

### A. Authentication & Access Control
- **Bcrypt/Argon2 Hashing**: Laravel's default `hashed` cast for secure credential storage.
- **AdminMiddleware**: Hardened separation of concerns; Employee roles cannot access administrative data.
- **SecurityHeaders Middleware**: Additional HTTP security headers applied globally.
- **CSRF & XSS Protection**: Native Laravel shields against web-based injection and forgery.

### B. Telemetry API Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Throttling (30 requests/min) to mitigate DoS and coordinate injection attacks.
- **Input Sanitization**: Strict validation of Latitude and Longitude coordinate precision.

### C. Personnel Data Privacy
- **Encrypted Transmission**: HTTPS-only protocol recommended for all production telemetry.
- **Audit Logs**: Immutable `employee_locations` table for reliable historical tracking.

## 4. Assessment Findings

| Category | Risk | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| SQL Injection | Low | Mitigated via Eloquent parameter binding. | **Verified** |
| Broken Access Control | Low | AdminMiddleware verifies role per session. | **Verified** |
| Throttling Abuse | Medium | Rate limiting implemented on check-in API. | **Mitigated** |
| PII Exposure | Low | Sensitive fields protected via RBAC. | **Verified** |

## 5. Security Recommendations
- Ensure `APP_ENV=production` enforces `FORCE_HTTPS=true`.
- Implement automated dependency scanning in the CI/CD pipeline.
- Periodic rotation of `APP_KEY` and database credentials.
