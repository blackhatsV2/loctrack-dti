# Master Project Plan: Employee Location Tracking System

The **Master Plan** consolidates all strategic initiatives for the Employee Location Tracking System (Loctrack DTI) into a unified development and operations guide.

---

## 1. Strategic Project Overview
Loctrack DTI is a modern workforce visibility solution designed to provide real-time location telemetry for field-based teams.
- **Objective**: Maximize operational efficiency through accurate, real-time location snapshots.
- **Value Proposition**: Replaces manual check-ins with automated, geocoded, and immutable tracking logs.

---

## 2. Core Functional Modules

### A. Real-time Command Center
- **Live Fleet Map**: Visual distribution of the active workforce using Leaflet.js.
- **Reporting Feed**: Instant visibility into the latest check-ins across the organization.

### B. Audit & Compliance Engine
- **Personnel History**: Comprehensive track logs for every employee.
- **Geocoding Service**: Automated translation of GPS coordinates into human-readable addresses.
- **Data Integrity**: Immutable reporting logs coupled with API rate limiting.

### C. Workforce CRM
- **User Management**: Centralized directory of employees, office assignments, and contact data.
- **Role Control**: Strict separation between Employee (Reporting) and Admin (Monitoring) roles.

## 3. Technical Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Deployment (Current)
- [x] GPS Capture via browser Geolocation API.
- [x] Admin dashboard with live activity feed.
- [x] Responsive design for field mobile use.
- [x] Containerized deployment (Docker/Sail).

### Phase 2: Enhanced Visualization
- [ ] Sector-based heatmaps for workforce density.
- [ ] Advanced date-range filtering for history logs.
- [ ] Exportable PDF/Excel reports for compliance auditing.

### Phase 3: Automation & Integration
- [ ] **Geofencing**: Automated alerts when entering/exiting specific office zones.
- [ ] **Mobile App**: Native iOS/Android builds for background tracking.
- [ ] **Third-party Sync**: API integration with existing HR and Payroll systems.

## 4. Security & VAPT Highlights
The system implements high-security standards for PII and location data:
- **RBAC**: AdminMiddleware ensures unauthorized users cannot access location logs.
- **Throttling**: 30 requests per minute limit to prevent DoS on the tracking API.
- **Encryption**: HTTPS-only transmission for all coordinate telemetry.
- **VAPT Status**: All identified categories (SQLi, CSRF, Access Control) are verified as **Mitigated**.
