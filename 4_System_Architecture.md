# System Architecture: Preparedness, Safety & Continuity Portal: Workforce Locator

This document describes the high-level architecture and technology stack of the Preparedness, Safety & Continuity Portal: Workforce Locator system.

## Architecture Pattern
The application follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern.

- **Model**: Eloquent ORM (e.g., `User.php`, `EmployeeLocation.php`) manages data logic and MySQL interactions.
- **View**: Responsive Blade templates enhanced with **Tailwind CSS v4** and **Alpine.js**.
- **Controller**: Logic handlers (e.g., `LocationController`, `AdminController`, `DisasterController`) managing input validation, API orchestration, and response routing.

## Technology Stack

### Core Frameworks
- **Backend**: Laravel 12 (PHP 8.2+)
- **Frontend**: Blade, Tailwind CSS v4
- **Database**: MySQL (optimized with indexed time-series data)

### Specialized Integrations
- **Maps**: Leaflet.js for interactive geographical plotting of personnel and hazards.
- **Charts**: Chart.js for dashboard visualizations (distribution, density).
- **API**: 
    - HTML5 Geolocation API for coordinate capture.
    - **USGS API**: For live earthquake data.
    - **NASA EONET API**: For global natural events tracking.
- **Build System**: Vite 7 for modern asset bundling.

## Infrastructure & Ops
- **Containerization**: Docker-ready (via Sail/Dockerfile).
- **Deployment**: Configured for PaaS platforms (e.g., Northflank/Render) via Nixpacks.
- **Environment**: Managed through `.env` for secure configuration.

## Key System Components

### 1. Telemetry API Terminal
A RESTful interface (`/api/location`) that validates and persists GPS data. Includes built-in throttling for stability and reverse-geocoding for human-readable addresses.

### 2. Disaster Orchestration Layer
The `DisasterController` manages the fetching, normalization, and caching of live disaster data from external providers (USGS, NASA), making it available for the Command Center.

### 3. Unified Command Center
Protected by `AdminMiddleware`, this layer provides the visualization engine that synchronizes employee positions with disaster markers, fault lines, and volcano layers.

### 4. Logic & Data Flow
Employee Dashboard -> Browser Geolocation -> POST /api/location -> Laravel Controller -> MySQL Storage -> Admin Map View (Leaflet) <- Disaster Data Sync (USGS/NASA)
